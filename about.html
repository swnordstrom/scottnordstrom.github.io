		<h3>Current Projects</h3>
      <p>
		      <b>Population dynamics and regulation of evolutionary rescue.</b> We are working on adding new demographic and genetic features to existing models of evolutionary rescue and testing model predictions with <i>Triboleum</i> flour beetles. I am doing this work with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/melbourne/">Brett Melbourne</a> at CU Boulder and <a href="http://www.hufbauerlab.org/">Ruth Hufbauer</a> at Colorado State University.

		      <b>Effects of fire on population growth rates in a grassland herb</b>. I am constructing a matrix projection models for several populations of <i>Echinacea angustifolia</i> in Minnesota. In particular, I am quantifying the contributions of individual demographic rates (e.g., increased flowering, increased survival) to population-level responses to fire. I am doing this work with Stuart Wagenius and the <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/">Echinacea Project</a> and <a href = "https://www.bethel.edu/academics/faculty/dykstra-amy"> Amy Dykstra</a> at Bethel University.

		<h3>Prior projects</h3>
		  <p>
		      For my senior thesis at the College of William and Mary, I modeled a selection-migration balance in populations of birds in mercury-contaminated habitat. I then implemented this model, using simulations to determine which demographic and spatial processes were most influential in the fixation of a tolerance allele or migration load occurring in contaminated and uncontaminated populations. I worked on this project with <a href="https://http://www.people.wm.edu/~mdlama/" target="_blank">M. Drew Lamar</a>. <a href="https://publish.wm.edu/honorstheses/188/">Read more about this project here.</a>
		  </p>
      <p>
          I worked with colleagues in the <a href="http://iqbiology.colorado.edu/">Interdisciplinary Quantitative Program</a> at CU Boulder to assess the effectiveness of interdisciplinary research institutes at producing more interdisciplinary research.
