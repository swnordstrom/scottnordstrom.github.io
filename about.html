		<h2>Current Projects</h2>
		
		<p>
		  Effects of fire on growth rates of the narrow-leaved purple coneflower (<i>Echinacea angustifolia</i>). I am constructing a matrix projection model for several populations of <i>Echinacea</i> in Minnesota. In particular, I am testing to see if growth rates post-fire are driven by increased flowering effort, or by other demographic rates. I am doing this work with Stuart Wagenius and the <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/">Echinacea Project</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Measuring interdisciplinarity of research at major univerisites. I am working with other members of the <a href="http://iqbiology.colorado.edu">Integrated Quantitative Biology</a> program at CU Boulder to assess the effectiveness of interdisciplinary research institutes at producing more interdisciplinary research.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Quantifying individual plant species response to habitat fragmentation. This is using data collected at the Wog Wog Habitat Fragmentation Experiment site in New South Wales, Australia. I am working on this project with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/eeb/facultysites/melbourne/">Brett Melbourne</a> and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/eeb/EEBprojects/DaviesLab/index.html">Kendi Davies</a>.

		<h2>Past projects</h2>
		
		<p>
		  For my senior thesis at the College of William and Mary, I modeled a selection-migration balance in populations of birds in mercury-contaminated habitat. I then implemented this model, using simulations to determine which demographic and spatial processes were most influential in the fixation of a tolerance allele or migration load occurring in contaminated and uncontaminated populations. I worked on this project with <a href="https://http://www.people.wm.edu/~mdlama/">M. Drew Lamar</a>. <a href="https://publish.wm.edu/honorstheses/188/">Read more about this project here.</a>
